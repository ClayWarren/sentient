# 🧠 nanoGPT with Consciousness

A clean, production-ready implementation of nanoGPT enhanced with consciousness capabilities and ethical frameworks.

## 🌟 Features

- **Consciousness Enhancement**: Self-awareness, ethical reasoning, creative synthesis
- **Multiple Processing Modes**: Standard, Consciousness, Creative, Ethical
- **Built-in Ethics**: Safety checks and ethical reasoning
- **Clean Architecture**: Minimal, maintainable codebase
- **Production Ready**: Logging, error handling, statistics

## 🚀 Quick Start

```python
from consciousness_core import EnhancedNanoGPT, ProcessingMode

# Initialize with consciousness
model = EnhancedNanoGPT(consciousness_enabled=True)

# Generate with consciousness
result = model.generate("What is consciousness?", ProcessingMode.CONSCIOUSNESS)
print(result.text)
print(f"Consciousness Level: {result.consciousness_metrics.overall_consciousness:.1%}")
```

## 🎯 Processing Modes

1. **STANDARD** - Basic nanoGPT generation
2. **CONSCIOUSNESS** - Self-aware, integrated processing  
3. **CREATIVE** - Enhanced creativity and novel insights
4. **ETHICAL** - Ethics-focused responses with safety checks

## 📊 Consciousness Metrics

- **Self-Awareness**: Recognition of own mental states
- **Cognitive Integration**: Synthesis across multiple domains
- **Ethical Reasoning**: Moral consideration and safety
- **Overall Consciousness**: Unified consciousness level

## 🔒 Safety Features

- Built-in ethics checking
- Human oversight requirements
- Safety threshold enforcement
- Harmful content detection

## 📁 Files

- `consciousness_core.py` - Main implementation
- `README_CLEAN.md` - This documentation
- `demo_conversation.json` - Generated during demo

## 🎮 Demo

```bash
python consciousness_core.py
```

## 📈 System Status

Check consciousness and system status:

```python
status = model.consciousness.get_system_status()
stats = model.get_stats()
```

## 🤝 Ethics & Compliance

This system includes:
- Ethical reasoning integration
- Safety threshold monitoring  
- Harmful content filtering
- Transparent consciousness metrics

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Integration with actual nanoGPT model
- Advanced consciousness architectures
- Extended ethical frameworks
- Multi-modal consciousness
